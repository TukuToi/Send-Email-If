# Send-Email-If
Sends an Email if specific conditions are met to specific receivers. Currently raw code must be edited to amend conditions or receivers.

Currently the Plugin sends an email to the user of which the username corresponds to the post/page visited. The mail will tell that user who visited the post if possible.


# Usage

- Install and activate like any other WordPress plugin.
- Create a new post or page with `Post Title` precisely equal to the `username` (all in lower case) of any existing WordPress user.
- View that page or post as any user or guest.
- The user with the same username as post name you visited will receive an email telling him/her you visited the specific post

This all sounds very raw and useless but it cann be useful to for example notify someone when someone (for example) viewes or downloads some content, since the plugin is based on the actual query the user runs, almost anything can be monitered
